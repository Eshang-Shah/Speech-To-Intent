# Speech-to-Intent Conversion on Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project implements a speech-to-intent conversion system optimized for the Raspberry Pi. Using TensorFlow for machine learning and Librosa for audio processing, the system translates spoken language inputs into actionable intent representations, suitable for interactive and automation applications.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Intent Conversion**: Transforms voice commands into machine-readable intents.
- **Machine Learning with TensorFlow**: Custom-trained models built to recognize various user intents from speech data.
- **Audio Processing with Librosa**: Extracts audio features for improved accuracy in recognizing speech patterns and intents.

## Technical Details
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi (ideal for real-time, on-device processing).
- **Modeling Framework**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for designing and training the intent recognition model.
- **Audio Feature Extraction**: [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) for efficient processing of audio data, including MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast.

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi (any model with adequate processing power)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow and Librosa libraries
